## Project Description
This project aims to classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers based on health insurance data. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, region, insurance charges, and smoking status. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation studies, and logistic regression modeling, the project identifies patterns and predictors associated with smoking behavior to build a predictive classification model.
