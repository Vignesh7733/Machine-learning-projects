       "\"Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed.

Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.<br /><br />This movie is great for kids who want to learn about Martial Arts and the Chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.<br /><br />Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I can't see her playing a serious role. It was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over Shin. Shin couldn't act at all, and everything was totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing I came up with was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so Power Ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid. The characters weren't likable and I just couldn't stand to watch it. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other movies like Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, & Stuck in the Suburbs.<br /><br />If you like action-adventure and corny jokes, you'll like this movie.\""

       "\"most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about; a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11, 2001. what you probably won't know before seeing this film is this: how that would feel; what do you do with that; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day? the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson, (don cheadle) and ex-college roommate charlie fineman, (adam sandler) solidifies and begins to take shape. characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact, stay with this story, and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate. real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates. the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character ?brilliantly revealed by sandler, as layers of an onion ? one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined. it's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen. cheadle's alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle. always watchable, the ease that's apparent when cheadle's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills. alan's relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture, just as the situation would demand. fineman doesn't want friendship, nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet, the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie. it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlie's carefully sealed life. there is inherent danger in the process. the more alan nudges charlie to open up, going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst, (liv tyler) the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge. it's an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial. he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss. unfortunately, his grief is one thing he cannot deny. sandler withdraws so deeply into his character's pain during the story's unfolding that, by the time he meets his demons head-on, the viewer shares his pain almost equally. alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home-life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane. (jada pinkett smith) while tending to charlie's recovery, alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man. his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost. the theme is much like the fisher king; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss. like the fisher king, the story concludes with the traditional, there is someone for everyone theme. reign over me's lidia sinclair, (played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king) is donna remar, (saffron burrows) a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnson's, who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlie's borderline insanity. it's a good ending to the story, but the one element probably least likely to ring true. then again, maybe there really is someone for everyone. devorah macdonald vancouver, bc\""

       "'most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about  a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11  2001  what you probably won t know before seeing this film is this  how that would feel  what do you do with that  and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day  the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson   don cheadle  and ex college roommate charlie fineman   adam sandler  solidifies and begins to take shape  characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact  stay with this story  and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable   and accurate  real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates  the pain inside charlie s soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character  brilliantly revealed by sandler  as layers of an onion   one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined  it s so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen  cheadle s alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle  always watchable  the ease that s apparent when cheadle s on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills  alan s relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture  just as the situation would demand  fineman doesn t want friendship  nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet  the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie  it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlie s carefully sealed life  there is inherent danger in the process  the more alan nudges charlie to open up  going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst   liv tyler  the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge  it s an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial  he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss  unfortunately  his grief is one thing he cannot deny  sandler withdraws so deeply into his character s pain during the story s unfolding that  by the time he meets his demons head on  the viewer shares his pain almost equally  alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home life   run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane   jada pinkett smith  while tending to charlie s recovery  alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man  his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost  the theme is much like the fisher king  another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss  like the fisher king  the story concludes with the traditional  there is someone for everyone theme  reign over me s lidia sinclair   played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king  is donna remar   saffron burrows  a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnson s  who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlie s borderline insanity  it s a good ending to the story  but the one element probably least likely to ring true  then again  maybe there really is someone for everyone  devorah macdonald vancouver  bc'"
