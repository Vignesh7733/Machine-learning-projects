## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying apple quality (good/bad) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset includes features such as `Size`, `Weight`, `Sweetness`, `Crunchiness`, `Juiciness`, `Ripeness`, `Acidity`, and a `Quality` label. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance to identify key factors influencing apple quality.
