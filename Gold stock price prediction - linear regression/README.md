## Project Description
This project aims to predict gold stock prices using historical data and linear regression. The dataset includes daily stock metrics (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume) from 2014 to 2024. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering (splitting dates into Day/Month/Year), correlation analysis, and model development to identify relationships between stock metrics and future prices.
